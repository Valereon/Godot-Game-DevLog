WARNING THERE IS NO PROPER PUNCTUATION IN THESE DEVLOGS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED 


//The frustation and bad tutorials

I started making my game today and it was frustrating experince to say the least i had a few setbacks of de motivation but today i did get some stuff done i started
i started with trying out some tutorials i try to steer clear of tutorials but its been hard because im a numbskull and love torturing myself by constantly switching 
engines and frameworks like i switched from godot to unity to Love2D and im back to godot so maybe ill stick with this one besides the point today i followed a tutorial
but in the comments someone was talking about bad practices and it was just not a great tutorial


//The Motivation

so i ended up deciding fuck it ill do it myself ill figure out a gun system inspired by the one garbaj [made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKV0HS3u0A&ab_channel=Garbaj)
i started to make my own weapons pickup system for today it was to get the weapon being recognized in an efficent way aswell as making it infintily extensible unlike garbajs
tutorial which forced you to manually enter a bunch of code for each weapon but with my system i was hoping to make it some each gun has a script with its stats, firemodes, mods,
and type to differantiate immeditly wether or not it was an item or a weapon then it narrows it down from there i did end up getting something very simple working


// the end result

i have made it so that i recgonizes the name of the weapon and displays it onscreen
